# Sets: Unordered collection of unique elements.
# Uses: For removing duplicates and performing mathematical operations such as Union, Insertion, and Difference.
# Difference: Sets are unordered and do not index elements.

# Frozen sets: Immutable sets.

# Use sets when order doesnâ€™t matter, but uniqueness does
# Prefer sets over lists for membership testing with large collections
# Use frozen sets when you need an immutable set (like dictionary keys)
# Remember that sets can only contain hashable elements
