Sr no.1 Title: Developer Testing
Subtitle: Building Quality Into Software
Publised Date: 2016
Description: To build high-quality software, you need to write testable code. That's harder than it seems: it requires insights drawn from arenas ranging from software craftsmanship to unit testing, refactoring to test-driven development. Most programming books either discuss testing only briefly, or drill down on just one or two techniques, with little guidance on how to systematically verify code. Most testing books, on the other hand, focus on a specific testing process, without showing how to write software that can be easily and systematically tested. In Developer Testing, leading software engineering consultant Alexander Tarnowski strikes an optimal balance, integrating insights from multiple disciplines to help frustrated practitioners get better results. Drawing on his extensive experience as a mentor and trainer, he offers insights that help you accelerate through the typical software assurance learning curve, so you can progress far more rapidly. Tarnowski organizes his insights into "chunks" to help you quickly absorb key concepts, and focuses on technology-agnostic approaches you can keep using with any new language, platform, or toolset. The first guide to cover testing mindset, techniques, and applications from the developer's perspective, Developer Testing will help developers get what they really want: better code. -- Provided by publisher.

Subtitle: Tools and Strategies for Delivering Your Software
Publised Date: 2004-05-07
Description: "Two thumbs up" ‚ÄîGregory V. Wilson, Dr. Dobbs Journal (October 2004) No one can disparage the ability to write good code. At its highest levels, it is an art. But no one can confuse writing good code with developing good software. The difference‚Äîin terms of challenges, skills, and compensation‚Äîis immense. Coder to Developer helps you excel at the many non-coding tasks entailed, from start to finish, in just about any successful development project. What's more, it equips you with the mindset and self-assurance required to pull it all together, so that you see every piece of your work as part of a coherent process. Inside, you'll find plenty of technical guidance on such topics as: Choosing and using a source code control system Code generation tools--when and why Preventing bugs with unit testing Tracking, fixing, and learning from bugs Application activity logging Streamlining and systematizing the build process Traditional installations and alternative approaches To pull all of this together, the author has provided the source code for Download Tracker, a tool for organizing your collection of downloaded code, that's used for examples throughout this book. The code is provided in various states of completion, reflecting every stage of development, so that you can dig deep into the actual process of building software. But you'll also develop "softer" skills, in areas such as team management, open source collaboration, user and developer documentation, and intellectual property protection. If you want to become someone who can deliver not just good code but also a good product, this book is the place to start. If you must build successful software projects, it's essential reading.
